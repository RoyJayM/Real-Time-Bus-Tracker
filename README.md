<H1>Usage</h1>
<p>MBTA Route 1 buses geolocation in real time every 15 seconds, and I attached to them their own markers with the bus number to identify them.</p><a href="https://royjaym.github.io/Real-Time-Bus-Tracker/" target="_blank">View the live feed here </a> 
<H1>Future Updates</h1>
<p>Mapbox API and MBTA were used as API feeds. In future i plan to use Google maps.<p>
